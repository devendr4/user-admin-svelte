# User admin with Svelte

To run this project follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies with you package manager of choice. For this project I've used `bun`. So in my case it would be:

```
bun install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following contents:

```
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/
```

4. Build the project with the following command:

```
bun run build
```

5. Start the server with the following command:

```
bun run preview
```
